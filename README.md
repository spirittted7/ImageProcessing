# Image Filter and Stylization Tool

This Python project provides a command-line tool for applying various filters and stylization effects to images using OpenCV and other relevant libraries. 
It offers a user-friendly interface with a variety of options to transform and enhance your images directly from the command line.

## Features

*   **Filtering:** Apply common image filters such as:
    *   Sepia
    *   Negative
    *   Grayscale
    *   Color filters (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta)
    *   Temperature filters (Warm, Cold)
*   **Stylization:** Experiment with creative stylization effects:
    *   Sketch
    *   Contouring
    *   Sobel
    *   Emboss

**Command-line Interface:**  Easy-to-use command-line interface powered by `argparse`.

**Flexible:** Supports a variety of image formats (dependent on OpenCV support).

**Extensible:** Designed to be easily extended with new filters and stylization techniques.
